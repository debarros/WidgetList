# WidgetList
In R Shiny, create arbitrarily many widgets based on input

see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23226627/automatic-gui-generating-in-r-shiny

Currently, the term `WidgetVector` is used frequently in the code.  This is a misnomer, since the widgets are contained in a list.

The first tab in the app shows how to use an input to determine the number of `radioButton` widgets to display.

The second tab shows how to create a grid of radio buttons.  This is not yet complete.
